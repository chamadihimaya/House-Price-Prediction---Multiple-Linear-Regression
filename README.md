# House Price-Prediction - Multiple-Linear-Regression


This script involves building a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including handling categorical variables by converting them to numerical format. The data is then scaled using MinMaxScaler. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is trained on the training data. The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (r2) score. Feature coefficients are extracted to understand their impact on the predicted prices. The script provides insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable, offering a foundation for predictive modeling in housing price estimation.
